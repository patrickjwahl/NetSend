A local area network chat application I've been working on since I started learning Java. Because I made the program 
while learning the language, the code is a bit haphazard in places. Still, the result works well; the application allows
the user to have a one-on-one chat conversation with another user on the local area network by entering in an IP address.
However, multiple conversations can be held on different channels if the user runs two instances of the application. The 
program also supports a friends list, in which IP addresses can be stored under different names.
